This diploma thesis was carried out as part of the international research and development project CitCom.ai financed by European funds. It focuses on the development and use of artificial intelligence, including in the field of geoinformation processing. The CitCom.ai project is financed by the European Commission under the Digital Europe program [S1]. The Warsaw University of Technology, as a partner of this project, implements its ideas by creating geoinformation tools supporting the vision of revitalization of the WUT central campus. The project uses both artificial intelligence and the idea of gamification implemented using geoinformatics tools by creating the so-called serious games.
