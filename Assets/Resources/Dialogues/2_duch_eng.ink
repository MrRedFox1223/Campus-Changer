Not everyone agrees with that, so please, talk to them. When you approach them, they'll tell you how they see this part of the Central Campus and present their arguments.

        Okay. -> TimeForDecision

In that case, there are some interesting conversations ahead of you. An exchange Student wants to create a small food corner here, like an outdoor eatery. 
A Lady living on campus suggests having a green space here. The Guard says a parking lot would be better. And then there's the Doctor who dreams of an open-air gallery.


    * [That's my cue then!]

Come back to me when you're done talking. I'm awaiting your decision.

What's your decision? There are several options: the greenery, a food corner, a parking lot, and a gallery. #portrait:GeniusLoci
